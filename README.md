# Erratum and revision to a previous paper
These days, I will make a revision on the experiment of the previous paper 'Collaborative-Recommendation-based-on-Variational-Automatic-Coding-Machine'. In the origianl version, I am sorry for that the experiment setting and the figure are somewhere confused with other already finished projects because of carelessness, though not seriously influence the total result. I have tried to send a revision version to the conference, whereas it's not permitted. In spite of this, I will revise it and prevent misleading others.

If you are interested in this work, please refer to this instead of the original!
